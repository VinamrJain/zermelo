"""A balloon drifts in an unknown wind, steering only by which altitude it flies at.

s = (lat, lon, p, r, W)             where it is, which altitude, what resource is left, the wind carrying it
a in {0, 1, 2}                      down one altitude, hold, up one
W(lat, lon, p) = (u, v)             metres per second, u eastward and v northward
(lat, lon)' = (lat, lon) + W(s) h   the wind carries it, h hours to a step
p' = p + a - 1, r' = r - |p' - p|   an altitude change spends one unit of resource, and needs r > 0
W = F + e                           the truth is the forecast F the agent is given, plus a drawn error e

A plan and a belief are written over (lat, lon, p) alone; r is a scalar the world carries and the
method prices
